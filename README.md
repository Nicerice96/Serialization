Certainly! Here's a question for you:

**Question: Implement Serialization in Java**

Create a simple Java class representing a `Person` with attributes like `name`, `age`, and `address`. Implement the `Serializable` interface to make instances of the `Person` class serializable. Write code to serialize an instance of `Person` to a file and then deserialize it back. Finally, print the deserialized `Person` object.

Feel free to structure the class, perform serialization, and handle exceptions appropriately. If you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to ask!
